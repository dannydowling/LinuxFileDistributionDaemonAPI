The idea of this text file is to have the user list IP addresses for remote locations.
The app uses the FXP protocol to send the files first to one machine and then through FXP.
Initiates a transfer from that remote machine to the next computers in the block. Aggregating the file transfer speed as 
more computers recieve the information.
