This thing.... so there's a maui app that should show a frontend and theres a backend for a linux box.

The idea is that you use the front end to select files and destinations and the api makes packets and distributes what you send it
in an efficient file copy mechanism.

The idea being that if say, one of your remote locations is ext4 and others ntfs. It would be useful to send to this api
and have it write both formats. Since windows doesn't.
